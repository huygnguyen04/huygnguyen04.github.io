Hi there!👋 I am Huy Nguyen, a second-year student at the University of Virginia majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics. 

Originally from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, I moved to the U.S. to further my studies as an international student - with a long-term goal of pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science.
